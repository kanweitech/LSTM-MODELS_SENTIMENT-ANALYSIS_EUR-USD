# LSTM-MODELS_SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS_EUR-USD
create a Python app that uses LSTM or ARIMA along with sentiment analysis to predict EUR/USD trading using high-frequency data from an API


The main components are:

1. **Data Collection**: Consuming high-frequency data from a trading app's API.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Incorporate sentiment data, possibly from news or social media.
3. **Prediction Models**: Use either LSTM (a type of neural network) or ARIMA (a statistical model) for time series forecasting.

4. **Trading Strategy**: Make predictions and possibly execute trades based on those predictions.

OANDA has a REST API that provides forex data. I'll need to get real-time or historical EUR/USD prices. Since it's high frequency, maybe the data is tick data or 1-minute intervals.

Next, sentiment analysis. Where to get the sentiment data? Maybe use a news API like NewsAPI or a social media API like Twitter. Alternatively, there are specialized financial sentiment APIs. The idea is to fetch recent news headlines or tweets related to EUR/USD and analyze their sentiment scores. Positive sentiment might indicate the EUR will rise, negative the opposite.

For the prediction models, ARIMA is good for univariate time series with trends, while LSTM can handle more complex patterns and multiple features. Since combining price data with sentiment, LSTM might be better because it can handle multiple input features. However, ARIMA could be used for the time series part, and sentiment as an external variable (SARIMAX). But maybe the user wants a more modern approach with LSTM. I should outline both options but perhaps implement one.

High-frequency data can be noisy, so preprocessing is crucial. For LSTM, I'll need to normalize the data and create sequences. For ARIMA, check stationarity and difference if needed.

Then, integrating the sentiment score into the model. For example, each data point includes the price and a sentiment score. The model would then use both to predict future prices.

Trading strategy: Once the model makes a prediction, decide whether to buy or sell. For instance, if the predicted price is higher than the current, buy, else sell. Risk management is important hereâ€”maybe set stop-loss and take-profit levels.

Potential challenges: High-frequency data requires efficient processing. Also, model training on streaming data might need online learning or frequent retraining. Latency could be an issue if the app is making real-time trades.

Now, structuring the app. The main components would be:

1. **Data Fetcher**: Fetches price data and sentiment data from APIs.

2. **Preprocessor**: Cleans and prepares the data for the model.

3. **Sentiment Analyzer**: Processes text data to generate sentiment scores.

4. **Model Trainer**: Builds and trains the LSTM or ARIMA model.

5. **Predictor**: Makes predictions using the trained model.
6. **Trading Engine**: Executes trades based on predictions (optional, as live trading requires brokerage integration and proper authentication).

Let me outline the steps in code:

- Use OANDA's API for forex data. They provide historical and real-time data. Need an API key and account ID.

- Use NewsAPI to get news articles related to EUR/USD. Then, apply a sentiment analysis model like VADER from NLTK or a pre-trained transformer model.

- Preprocess the data: merge the time series data with sentiment scores, handle missing values, normalize.
- For LSTM: create sequences of past data points (window size) including both prices and sentiment.

- Train the LSTM model on historical data, validate on a test set.

- For ARIMA: grid search for optimal parameters, include sentiment as an exogenous variable.

- Make predictions, compare with actual data, and generate trading signals.

  
1. Import necessary libraries: requests for API calls, pandas for data handling, numpy, tensorflow/keras for LSTM, statsmodels for ARIMA, nltk for sentiment analysis.

2. Fetch price data from OANDA:

- Set up API credentials.

- Define function to get candles (OHLC data) in high frequency (e.g., M1 or S10).

- Convert to DataFrame.

3. Fetch news data from NewsAPI:

- Search for "EUR/USD" or related terms.

- Extract headlines and published times.

- Compute sentiment scores for each headline.
- Aggregate sentiment scores by time interval (e.g., average per minute).

4. Merge price data and sentiment data on timestamps.

5. Preprocess data:

- Handle missing values (forward fill or interpolate).

- Normalize price data (MinMaxScaler).

- Create sequences for LSTM: using past 'n' steps to predict next step.

6. Build and train LSTM model:
- Define model architecture (layers, units).

- Compile with optimizer and loss function.

- Train on historical data.

7. Make predictions:

- Use the latest data window to predict next price.

- Compare prediction to current price to generate signal (buy/sell).

8. (Optional) Execute trade via API.

9. Schedule the script to run at high frequency (e.g., every minute) using a scheduler like cron or a while loop with sleep.

Possible issues to handle:

- **API Rate Limits**: Ensure not to exceed API request limits.

- **Data Synchronization**: Align the timestamps of price and sentiment data.

- **Model Retraining**: Decide how often to retrain the model with new data.

- **Latency**: Processing time should be less than the data frequency to avoid delays.

Security considerations: Store API keys securely, perhaps in environment variables.

Testing: Backtest the model on historical data before live trading.

Key Components Explained:

Data Fetching:

fetch_price_data(): Retrieves EUR/USD price data from OANDA API

fetch_sentiment(): Gets news articles and calculates sentiment scores

Preprocessing:

Merges price and sentiment data

Normalizes features using MinMaxScaler

Creates time sequences for LSTM

Model Building:

Uses LSTM network with two layers

Trained to predict next period's closing price

Trading Strategy:

Simple threshold-based strategy

Generates BUY/SELL/HOLD signals

Requirements:
pip install pandas numpy requests tensorflow nltk schedule
python -m nltk.downloader vader_lexicon

Important Considerations:

API Integration:

Replace placeholder API keys with actual credentials

Consider rate limits and error handling

Use proper OANDA endpoints (practice vs live environment)

Model Improvements:

Add more technical indicators (RSI, MACD)

Incorporate order book data

Use more sophisticated sentiment analysis (BERT, GPT)

Implement proper backtesting framework

Disclaimer: This is a simplified educational example. Real trading systems require:

Proper risk management

Rigorous backtesting

Market microstructure understanding

Robust error handling

Compliance with broker API terms

Always test strategies thoroughly in a paper trading environment before considering live deployment.
